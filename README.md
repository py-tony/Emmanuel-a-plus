## Motherboard
The motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components together at one spot and allows them to talk to each other. Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact. Total motherboard functionality is necessary for a computer to work well.

- #### Processor

The processor, also known as the CPU, provides the instructions and processing power the computer needs to do its work. The more powerful and updated your processor, the faster your computer can complete its tasks. By getting a more powerful processor, you can help your computer think and work faster.

- #### Memory Ram slots

Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's short-term memory, which it uses to handle all active tasks and apps. None of your programs, files, games, or streams would work without RAM.

- #### Bus slots

Alternatively known as a bus slot or expansion port, an expansion slot is a connection or port inside a computer on the motherboard or riser card. It provides an installation point for a hardware expansion card to be connected
Why are slots used?
A slot is a computer processor connection designed to make upgrading the processor easier, where the user would only have to slide a processor into a slot. it is also used to extend the capability or of the computer because we can plug in extra drivers like a video driver.

- #### CMOS battery

CMOS stands for “Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.” The CMOS battery powers the BIOS firmware in your laptop [2]. BIOS needs to remain operational even when your computer isn't plugged into a power source. That's where the battery comes in.
